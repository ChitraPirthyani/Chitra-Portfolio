A Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Time-series Forecasting of ComEd Energy Consumption Data](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/Time%20series%20Analysis-%20ComEd.R)
* Cleaned ComEd Consumption dataset and checked if it was stationary, normal and seasonal.
* Built hourly, daily and monthly models after chaning it to a ts() data sequence.
* Performed exploratory analysis including histograms, time plots, ACF and PACF plots, ADF tests.
* Created six models using ARIMA, SARIMA and regression analysis. 
* Applied Model Diagnostic techniques such as: Residual Analysis, Ljung Box test, ACF ofresiduals, backtesting, BIC , MAPE and RMSE - to test model performance. 
* Finally, performed forecasting trend analysis on the best performing model.

# [Project 2: Classification & Regression of Weather Data](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/DSC441%20Weather%20data%20Decision%20Trees.R)
* **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaned and pre-processed weather data with 6 million data points to arrive at 2 million data points.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Created descriptive plots including corr-plots, box plots and histograms.
* **Model Building:** Built models based on Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Regression and Classification.
* Created a Decision Tree to classify when the Sky is Over-cast, vs when is it not.
