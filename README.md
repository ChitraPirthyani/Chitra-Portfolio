* Cleaned ComEd Consumption dataset and checked if it was stationary, normal and seasonal.
* Built hourly, daily and monthly models after chaning it to a ts() data sequence.
* Performed exploratory analysis including histograms, time plots, ACF and PACF plots, ADF tests.
* Created six models using ARIMA, SARIMA and regression analysis. 
* Applied Model Diagnostic techniques such as: Residual Analysis, Ljung Box test, ACF ofresiduals, backtesting, BIC , MAPE and RMSE - to test model performance. 
* Finally, performed forecasting trend analysis on the best performing model.
