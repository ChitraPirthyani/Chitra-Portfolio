# Hi! I am **_Chitra Pirthyani_**.
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio.

# [Project 1: Time-Series Forecasting of ComEd Energy Consumption Data](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/Time%20series%20Analysis-%20ComEd.R)
* **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaned ComEd Consumption dataset and checked if it was stationary, normal and seasonal.
Built hourly, daily and monthly models after chaning it to a ts() data sequence.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Performed exploratory analysis including histograms, time plots, ACF and PACF plots, ADF tests.
* **Model Building:** Created six models using ARIMA, SARIMA and regression analysis. 
* Applied Model Diagnostic techniques such as: Residual Analysis, Ljung Box test, ACF ofresiduals, backtesting, BIC , MAPE and RMSE - to test model performance. 
* **Forecasting:** Finally, performed forecasting trend analysis on the best performing model.

# [Project 2: Classification & Regression of Weather Data](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/DSC441%20Weather%20data%20Decision%20Trees.R)
* **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaned and pre-processed weather data with 6 million data points to arrive at 2 million data points.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Created descriptive plots including corr-plots, box plots and histograms.
* **Model Building:** Built models based on Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Regression and Classification.
* **Classification:** Created a Decision Tree and a confusion matirx to classify when the Sky is Over-cast, vs when it is not.

# [Project 3: Twitter API](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/TwitterAPI.py)
* Accessed Twitter API to pull specific tweets with specific hashtags and keywords.
* Converted these tweets to a pandas dataframe and transported it to a csv file. 

# [Project 4: Advanced Machine Learning on Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/ChitraPirthyani/DataNerd/blob/master/Advanced%20Machine%20Learning%20-%201.ipynb)
* **Data Pre-processing:** Data cleaning and train-test splits.
* **Classification Models:** 1. Random Forest Classification
                             2. Gradient Boosting Classification
                             3. GridSearch CV Model
* **Metric Analysis :** Compared all classification models using the following metrics : ROC Curves, Precision Recall Curves, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Scores
